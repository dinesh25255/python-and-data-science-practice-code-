#in c c++ we writw that type of the code 

# int name ="dinesh bhatt" #in  c c++  we write a code that type 

name = 'dines bhatt'
print(name)

# in this  way we print name in python programming language 

# in short python is automatically understand what is data type

a = 2
b= 3
print(a+b)

#dynamic typing
a=5

#dynamic Binding
a=5
print(a)
a='dinesh'
print(a)
#in dynamic Binding there is no fix variable

#static Binding
# int a=5 #throw out of the program

#python can  support Dynamic Binding

a=1
b= 3
c=4
print(a,b,c)


#we can create a multiple variable
